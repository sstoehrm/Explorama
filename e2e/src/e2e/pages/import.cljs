;; once - but two of the three happen to share a button label ("Yes"), so
;; a wait keyed on the button alone can't tell which one is currently up.
;;
;; The fixture's CSV has no explicit id column, so the mapping's warning
;; dialog always appears once ("The ID for each row will be automatically
;; generated."); proceeding through it ("Yes") triggers the real backend
;; import-file call, whose success re-shows an import-summary dialog also
;; confirmed via "Yes" - that second click is the actual commit-import call.
