There are currently three versions of Explorama
- bundles/browser
- bundles/electron
- bundles/server

### General Prequisites
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
- [Java](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Make
- [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) - just for some tools

### Browser
The browser version is the easiest to develop for:
```bash
cd bundles/browser
npm install
bb gather-assets.bb.clj dev
clj -M:dev   # Figwheel on port 8020
```

### Electron
`bundles/electron` is split into `backend/` (Clojure backend + Electron
main/worker process) and `frontend/` (ClojureScript UI), each with its own
`deps.edn`/`package.json`. Run `make assets build_mode=dev` once, then start
each half's Figwheel REPL in its own terminal (`cd backend && clj -M:dev`,
`cd frontend && clj -M:dev` - both default to port 8020, so only one half can
bind it at a time). App packaging (issue #28) works again: `make build-linux`
runs the full prepare/verify/bundle chain and produces a boot-verified
`dist/electron/Explorama-linux.AppImage`; `make build-win` mirrors it but is
untested (no Windows/wine toolchain on hand). `make dev-app` compiles and
launches just the Electron main process for main-process dev - its UI/worker
windows won't load, since the per-half Figwheel dev builds don't emit the
`js/frontend.js`/`js/backend.js` files those windows expect (see the
Makefile's `dev-app` target for details).

### Server
See [bundles/server/README.md](../bundles/server/README.md): local dev
(`clj.deps.edn`/`cljs.deps.edn` + Figwheel) and a Docker Compose harness for
production-like auth/routing are both supported now.

### Folder structure
There are currently four places where you can find code:

#### Plugins
The plugins are shared code between all versions and are separated into backend and frontend code. There are also some tests 🥸.

#### Bundles

Bundles are containing the specific code for each version of Explorama.

#### Tools

Additional tooling for development.

#### Styles

Repoistory for the stylesheets and images.

## Contributing
